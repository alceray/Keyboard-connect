# Keyboard Connect

A keyboard tracking desktop application that monitors USB connections/disconnections and records keyboard usage. It aims to identify keyboards from a list of connected USB devices by scraping the [QMK Firmware repo](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and receiving user input when necessary.

## Setup

For development:

- `npm start` to run
- `npm run dev` to build and run at the same time
